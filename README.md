# MLTools
Simple machine learning models implemented in python for the course Machine Learning for Engineers.

## Implemented models
    - Linear predictors: Linear Regression, Halfspace Classifier, RidgeRegression
    - Linear predictors with nonlinear transformation: Logistic Regression, Multivariate Logistic Regression
    - Feed-Forward Neural Networks (MLP), sigmoid activation and SGD optimizer
    - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
    - Independent Component Analysis (ICA)
    - kMeans
    - Naive Bayes and a mixed version with real valued features
    
    
## Extras
    - Metropolis Markov-Cahin-Monte-Carlo for the Ising model
    - RK4 for solving ODEs
    - Nealder-Mead simplex method for parameter identification in population dynamics
